# Welcome to my blog

Published on: 2025-10-07

This is the first post on my blog. It serves as an introduction on who I am, what I am currently doing and what I want to do next.

## Who I am

My name is Ben

## What I do

I am a 10+ years developer. I worked on many projects with different sizes and teammates, I started my journey using PHP and became a big fan of the Laravel framework. I was first a fullstack developer and soon specialized in backend and APIs development, but I kept an eye and an attraction on modern frontend frameworks like Vue.js and React.

## What's next

Find a brilliant and friendly team to flourish by improving great products.
